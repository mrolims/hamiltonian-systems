# hamiltonian-systems

Code repository accompanying my doctoral thesis entitled "Dynamical aspects of Hamiltonian systems: Chaos, stickiness, and recurrence plots".

This project contains the code to generate and plot all the data in the thesis.

## Citation

The results presented in the thesis are published in three different papers. If this project were of any help, feel free to cite these papers as well as the thesis itself and the Zenoro repository.
