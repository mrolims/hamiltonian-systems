# hamiltonian-systems

Code repository accompanying my doctoral thesis entitled "Dynamical aspects of Hamiltonian systems: Chaos, stickiness, and recurrence plots".

This project contains the code to generate and plot all the data in the thesis.

## Citation

The results presented in the thesis have been published in three different papers [1-3]. If this project was helpful in any way, please feel free to cite these papers, as well as the thesis itself [4] and the Zenoro archive [5].
